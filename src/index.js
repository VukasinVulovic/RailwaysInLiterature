      <h1 className='title'> Reading on the railways </h1>
      <p className='full-paragraph'>
        Train journeys occur at initiatory or climactic moments of large numbers of classic children’s utopian fantasies; 
        in these journeys, the railway functions as a protean, paradoxical space, not merely instrumental but instead active. Long after it vanished from the landscapes of the real world as a functional means of transport, 
        the steam train in particular continues to feature in works of fantasy aimed at children, 
        operating by laws often unlike those of the realms through which it passes, and providing 
        a space for the dramatisation of spiritual and emotional adventure. 
        Railway journeys serve an important role within the metaphorical as well as the narrative economy of utopian texts; 
        this role is sometimes a subversive one, and ultimately calls into question the relationship of reader to text. 
        Railway trains in utopian fantasy literature operate like alternative worlds, allowing space and time within the narrative for establishment, 
        subversion, and clashing of the logics and values of the other realms of the text. 
        In this way they can be described in terms of Foucault’s well-known formulation of “heterotopia“. 
        Heterotopia is <b>a concept of describing certain cultural, institutional and discursive spaces that are somehow 'other': disturbing, intense, incompatible, contradictory or transforming</b>.
        <br/>
        Heterotopias are worlds within worlds, mirroring and yet upsetting what is outside. 
        Some powerful accounts of the coming of the railways are to be found in English novels, 
        but the railways also shaped the development of fiction in material ways. 
        W H Smith and Sons developed on railway concourses (the first outlet was opened at Euston in 1848), selling cheaply priced novels. 
        The firm sponsored two shilling reprints of successful novels. 
        Special ‘railway editions’ were marketed by other publishers for reading on trains – notably George Routledge’s ‘Railway library’ of one shilling reprints. Novel reading and rail travel became closely connected. As the railway network grew, so did W H Smith’s bookselling business: by the end of the century it had well over 1000 station bookstalls.

      <h3 className='medium-title'> Symbols of destiny </h3>
      <p className='full-paragraph'>
        This irresistibility is something of a refrain, and railways often seem to symbolise destiny to Victorians. The railway accident, for instance, becomes a plot device in fiction. Carker, the villain of Dombey and Son, is killed by a train, as if the very forces of progress that he thinks he represents also destroys him. In Mrs Henry Wood’s best-selling sensation novel East Lynne (1861), the adulterous Isabel Carlyle is suitably punished when she is involved in a railway accident. Her child is killed and she is disfigured. In two other leading sensation novels, Mary Elizabeth Braddon’s Lady Audley’s Secret (1862) and Wilkie Collins’s No Name (1862), the protagonists have parents killed in train accidents.
        For the authors of 19th century Russia, the railway was an object of intense anxiety. A potent symbol of modernity, the irruption of the railway into the landscapes of agricultural Russia unsettled and disturbed, quickly coming to represent distinctly negative ideas of rupture and departure (the flip side of the association of rail-travel with progress and freedom so common in the contemporary West). These fears are articulated in many of the era’s ‘canonical’ works, which frequently construct moments of personal crisis around the image of the railway.
        Most famous, perhaps, is the climax of Leo Tolstoy’s Anna Karenina (in which the eponymous heroine, losing faith in herself and society, is driven to throw herself in the path of a train). Killed by means of a common, impersonal and uncaring instrument, at the moment of her death, Anna is lowered rather than raised, demythologised rather than ennobled. Her status as a ‘tragic hero’ in the classical tradition should be called into question by this ending. Having lost her position in society, she loses her position within the text itself. This cruel, radical negation destabilises the reader’s understanding of the novel, and leaves them with a deep sense of hopelessness and uncertainty at its close. Throughout the course of Leo Tolstoy’s iconic tragedy Anna Karenina, the presence of trains is essential both in terms of symbolic resonance and as a way to communicate social commentary and setting. Tolstoy employs train imagery as a way to talk about movement in terms of the fast-paced course of life, foreshadowing the desperate saga of Anna and Vronsky’s romantic relationship. In general, the existence of the railroad is meant to be viewed as a destructive force in the context of the novel, something that initiates death and devastation from its first mention in the text. This symbolic relationship is primarily evident during Anna and Vronsky’s initial meeting, their rendezvous on the train, and at the time of and following Anna’s suicide, using the significance of trains to trace the course of their relationship throughout the text as a sort of timeline, navigating the tumultuous end that eventually becomes inevitable for both.
        Far less well known, but equally powerful in its portrayal of these themes, is Anton Chekhov’s Platonov. In this work, the fate of the hero (hit by a train in a moment in equal parts horrific and farcical) again serves to demean and denigrate – depriving Platonov of his dignity as well as his life. Such texts, reflecting on the theme of Russian modernisation, confront the emerging future empty handed and with a sense of deep despair.
        Trains as symbols in literature give stories depth.  Trains are a place where people accidentally meet, go their separate ways, take the time to think, work on something, and even as a place of rest and relaxation. And here are some great examples of trains and literature:

        <ol>
          <li>
            <b>J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter applies “Hogwarts Express”</b> into many levels of her story. The train, in which all characters reunite after a summer without seeing each other, serves as a place of bonding. The train is where the characters tell each other stories about their adventures and update each other on their current activities
          </li>
          <li>
            In <b>“The Polar Express”  Chris Van Allsburg‘s</b> book, the train is the key element in the child’s experience.  Instead of the train transporting the children to a place where they will experience a great adventure, the magical train is where the adventures take place.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>The Christmas Train by David Baldacci</b> takes a disillusioned journalist Tom Langdon on a train journey from Washington D.C. to L.A in time for Christmas. The character travels by train that takes him on a journey of rude awakenings and a thrilling adventure. The train moves him across America and takes him into the rugged terrain of his own heart where he rediscovers people’s essential goodness and someone very special he believed he had lost.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Murder on the Orient Express by Agatha Christie. </b> What a dream for the mystery addict to find a much-loathed murder victim found aboard the luxurious Orient Express with multiple stab wounds and thirteen likely suspects, an incomparably brilliant detective in Hercule Poirot, and the most ingenious crime ever conceived?

        <u>Britain’s Weirdest Railways: </u>
        <b>Night on the Galactic Railroad(Lütfü Mete ŞEN):Kenji Miyazawa</b>

        Giovanni is a lonely boy, whose father is away on a long fishing trip, while his mother is ill at home. As a result, the young Giovanni must undertake paid jobs before and after school, delivering papers and setting type at the printers, in order to provide food for his poor family. These adult responsibilities leave him with no time to study or socialize, and he is ridiculed by his classmates. Apart from Giovanni's mother and sister, the only person who really cares for him is his former playmate Campanella, whose father is a close friend of Giovanni's father.
        During a lesson about the galaxy, the teacher asks Giovanni what the Milky Way is made of. Giovanni knows it is formed of stars, but is unable to say so, and Campanella does the same to save Giovanni from further teasing by the rest of the class. At the end of the lesson, the teacher encourages all the children to attend the festival of stars that evening. Upon returning home, Giovanni finds that no milk was delivered that day, so he heads out to the dairy to fetch it for his mother's dinner. Giovanni only encounters an elderly woman at the dairy, and once he pleads that his ill mother needs her milk that night, the woman advises him to come back later.
      
        Another superb book by Robin Jones, this time he’s been scouring the British Isles in search of the country’s weirdest railways.

        Perhaps the most revealing source on the railway and the nation in South Asia is in the area of literature. The railway is a frequently employed motif since it has the ability to bring people together as well as separate them and gives a panoramic view of a society and country. Three diverse novels will be explored so as to provide a varied and broad analysis on the topic at hand. The first of these is the novel Kim (1901) by Rudyard Kipling, and although this is Indo-Anglian fiction written long before independence, it is important because it looks at the nation whilst under British rule, and from the position of a hybrid child. In this book, Kim and the lama as well as a myriad of other characters travel by train throughout the country, thereby providing a colourful insight into the railway and the state of the nation. Khushwant Singh’s Train to Pakistan (1956) is set in the small border village of Mano Majra in India and has the horrific events of the Partition massacres as its backdrop. This story is informative because it illustrates the significance of the railway in the lives of the Mano Majrans and also the vital though unfortunate part it played during the division of the nation. Lastly, A Fine Balance (1995) by Rohinton Mistry, a diasporic writer, is set against the political unrest of the Emergency government in India in 1975-85. In this novel, the railway is as crucial in the transportation and bringing together of the protagonists, as it is in interpreting and critiquing the national politics of the time.

        Pershore Station, or A Liverish Journey First Class
        The train at Pershore station was waiting that Sunday night
        Gas light on the platform, in my carriage electric light,
        Gas light on frosty evergreens, electric on Empire wood,
        The Victorian world and the present in a moment's neighbourhood.
        There was no one about but a conscript who was saying good-bye to his love
        On the windy weedy platform with the sprinkled stars above
        When sudden the waiting stillness shook with the ancient spells
        Of an older world than all our worlds in the sound of the Pershore bells.
        They were ringing them down for Evensong in the lighted abbey near,
        Sounds which had poured through apple boughs for seven centuries here.

        With Guilt, Remorse, Eternity the void within me fills
        And I thought of her left behind me in the Herefordshire hills.
        I remembered her defencelessness as I made my heart a stone
        Till she wove her self-protection round and left me on my own.
        And plunged in a deep self pity I dreamed of another wife
        And lusted for freckled faces and lived a separate life.
        One word would have made her love me, one word would have made her turn
        But the word I never murmured and now I am left to burn.
        Evesham, Oxford and London. The carriage is new and smart.
        I am cushioned and soft and heated with a deadweight in my heart.

        -John Betjeman
        (Bakmtal1 -Lütfü Mete)

        <blockquote>
          Vast, unrevealed, in silence and the night
          Brooding, the ancient hills commune with sleep.
          Inviolate the solemn valleys keep
          Their contemplation. Soon from height to height
          Steals a red finger of mysterious light,
          And lion-footed through the forests creep
          Strange mutterings; till suddenly, with sweep
          And shattering thunder of resistless flight
          And crash of routed echoes, roars to view,
          Down the long mountain gorge the Night Express
          Freighted with fears and tears and happiness.
          The dread form passes; silence falls anew.
          And lo! I have beheld the thronged, blind world
          To goals unseen from God's hand onward hurled.

      <h3 className='medium-title'> Mugby Junction by Charles Dickens(Mustafa Koyun) </h3>
      <p className='full-paragraph'>
        Dickens never liked trains. He preferred stagecoaches, which are romanticised in Pickwick Papers. On 9 June 1865, his negative opinion was confirmed when he was involved in a railway crash at Staplehurst, Kent, in which 10 people died. Dickens did use trains afterwards, but always gripping the arm of the seat and feeling the carriage was "down on the right hand side". For the Christmas 1866 edition of Household Words magazine, he wrote three loosely-connected stories entitled Mugby Junction, which have often been collected as a single volume. The opening story, Barbox Brothers, includes brilliant descriptions of the vast, eponymous junction by night: "Mysterious goods trains, covered with palls and gliding on like vast weird funerals … " There is then a satire on railway refreshment rooms, Dickens having been slighted a few months beforehand by the staff of the refreshment room at Rugby. (Hence "Mugby".) The third piece is The Signal-Man, a ghost story about a train crash in a tunnel. It is often cited as the best ghost story ever written.

        The train had left
        Less than a minute before I arrived
        So I stood on the old platform
        Watching it fade into the darkness
        
        As the lights grew smaller and smaller
        It gave the appearance
        Of a cloud of fireflies
        Evaporating into a cold winters night
        
        Rounding the curve
        The train lights slowly disappeared
        One by one
        And I couldn’t help thinking to myself
        That one of those fireflies was you
        
        These days… as strange as it might seem
        Whenever lazy fireflies flash in a warm summer’s night
        My mind sees pictures of you
        Fading into winter on a firefly train

      <p className='full-paragraph'>
        Half a lifetime ago, Paul Theroux virtually invented the modern travel narrative by recounting his grand tour by train through Asia. In the three decades since, the world he recorded in that book has undergone phenomenal change. The Soviet Union has collapsed and China has risen; India booms while Burma smothers under dictatorship; Vietnam flourishes in the aftermath of the havoc America unleashed on it the last time Theroux passed through. And no one is better able to capture the texture, sights, smells, and sounds of that changing landscape than Paul Theroux.
        Theroux's odyssey takes him from Eastern Europe, still hung over from communism, through tense but thriving Turkey into the Caucasus, where Georgia limps back toward feudalism while its neighbor Azerbaijan revels in oil-fueled capitalism. Theroux is firsthand witness to it all, traveling as the locals do—by stifling train, rattletrap bus, illicit taxi, and mud-caked foot—encountering adventures only he could have: from the literary (sparring with the incisive Nobel laureate Orhan Pamuk) to the dissolute (surviving a week-long bender on the Trans-Siberian Railroad). And wherever he goes, from the European Union to the Pacific Rim and back, his omnivorous curiosity and unerring eye for detail never fail to inspire, enlighten, inform, and entertain.

      <p className='full-paragraph'>
        By Thomas Hardy
        We kissed at the barrier; and passing through
        She left me, and moment by moment got
        Smaller and smaller, until to my view
                        She was but a spot;
        A wee white spot of muslin fluff
        That down the diminishing platform bore
        Through hustling crowds of gentle and rough
                      To the carriage door.
        Under the lamplight’s fitful glowers,
        Behind dark groups from far and near,
        Whose interests were apart from ours,
                        She would disappear,
        Then show again, till I ceased to see
        That flexible form, that nebulous white;
        And she who was more than my life to me
                        Had vanished quite.
        We have penned new plans since that fair fond day,
        And in season she will appear again—
        Perhaps in the same soft white array—
                        But never as then!
        —‘And why, young man, must eternally fly
        A joy you’ll repeat, if you love her well?’
        —O friend, nought happens twice thus; why,
                        I cannot tell!
